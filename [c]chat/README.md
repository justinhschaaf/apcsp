# [c]chat

[c]chat (with the "c" being short for "code.org", as it was based there) was a chat
application I was working on using code.org's AppLab as a way to learn how it's databases worked; 
however, based on the fact that there were 0 database entries when I checked over a year later 
and the todo list,  I'm pretty sure I never finished it. This app was the basis and inspiration 
for my APCSP Create Task project [SMST](https://github.com/justinhschaaf/apcsp/tree/master/SMST), 
which the README for explains the systems this app also uses more in-depth.

You can find the original project [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/v5U3Cnru_DQseTVKlP3QEoI8JRSQna3QEvh7oifpKIA). It doesn't work, so I don't know why you'd want to.
