# JustinQuiz

JustinQuiz is a simple quiz game that I developed as my first project in APCSP.
The task was to develop a multi-screen app, and my app used the bare minimun (4)
while maintaining a dynamic quiz system with 50+ questions.

Near the end of development of this "app", I also started implementing a leaderboard
system that was never finished (see [lines 270-320](code.js#L270-L320)). This utilized
AppLab's data tables, and was laid out as follows: user, correct, total.

You can find the original project [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/ZL_OAGGttutC7gHldX985oU2eyoOIs4i5jj8w9OCnmA).

*Also note, I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the answers to the questions asked in the game.
Feel free to contribute corrections.*
