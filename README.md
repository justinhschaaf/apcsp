# APCSP

This repository is an archive of all my projects in my AP Computer Science Principles class. 
They were made using [code.org](https://code.org)'s AppLab. This repository simply contains 
the exported files from AppLab directly. I figured that since I no longer have a use for them 
except as reference, I might aswell let other aspiring developers utilize their potential value 
aswell.

## Steps to run / Applab API SRC

Because I couldn't find any solid information on the license of the AppLab code that comes with 
an exported project, I'm ignoring the directory where the files are stored (`/applab`). 

To acquire the code for yourself, I'd reccommend that you:

1. [Create a blank project on code.org's AppLab](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/new)

2. Go to Share > Show Advanced Options > Export and download the ZIP file.

3. Open the ZIP file and copy the `applab` directory to the project folder where you have cloned this repo.

## Included Projects

- [JustinQuiz](/JustinQuiz), a simple quiz game created as my first APCSP project.

- [ApplePicker](/ApplePicker), a simple clicker game extended from a class demo.

- [Beach Scene Example](/BeachSceneExample), a beach drawn by turtles.

- [\[c\]chat](/[c]chat), a non-functional chat application.

- [SMST](/SMST), a basic social media service which served as my APCSP Create Task.
